A clean and intuitive todo application built with React Native and Expo, featuring a unique straightforward week view that most todo apps lack.

## The Problem

Most todo applications don't provide a straightforward week view, making it difficult to plan and visualize tasks across an entire week. This app solves that problem by offering both a daily view and a comprehensive week view that organizes your todos by due dates.

## Features

### ðŸ“± Core Features
- **Clean Daily View**: See all your todos for today in a simple, organized list
- **Week View**: Unique week-by-week layout showing todos organized by their due dates
- **Add Todos**: Quick todo creation with detailed form including:
  - Task title and description
  - Category selection (Work, Personal, Health, Learning)
  - Priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
  - Due date selection
- **Todo Management**: Mark todos as complete and delete tasks (soon, edit details)

### Future Features
- Editing details
- Settings
- Backend Integration

## Tech Stack

- **React Native** with Expo
- **TypeScript**
- **Zustand** for state management
- **NativeWind** for styling (Tailwind CSS)
- **Expo Router** for navigation
